Call them what you like - Code Co-Pilot, Code Companion, Technical Teammate - your code co-pilot is one of your go-to lifelines throughout the core curriculum experience. In this article, we'll go over what this system aims to provide and how you can collaborate with your partner in order to excel in the program.

### Code Co-Pilot Rundown

Every 2 weeks, you will be paired with a new peer as your code co-pilot (buddy or partner). This partner is your go-to person for checking in, sharing notes, and getting started on assignments for those two weeks.

Create a private Slack channel with your code co-pilot, and be sure to invite the EEs. This channel can be used to asynchronously collaborate, discuss progress, and ask questions with your buddy.

At 1 pm on Thursdays, there is time reserved to debrief on the week with your code co-pilot. Plan for 30 minutes to check-in to reflect on the material, and share insights and notes from the week. Below are some guiding questions to start the conversation! Share your responses from the conversation in your designated Slack channel.

One of you should do an `et get code-co-pilot` and take notes in the provided `notes.md` file. Once everything is done, `et submit` the assignment and verify it is marked to private in the submissions tab. _See notes on submission below._

This intentional reflection might seem a bit hokey at first, but is truly important! Particularly because:

- Active reflection will help you integrate the cornucopia of topics and concepts introduced over the week
- This is a unique opportunity to share tips and tricks but also be _vulnerable_ about the material that is stumping you. Serve one another!
- Your buddy will keep you on your toes but also remind you that your experience is valid. The speed of this program can be tough to surmount, but conversations with a peer who is going through the same thing can make it a lot easier to handle

You may find that you and your buddy are somewhat different. That's okay! The better you can come to understand their experience, the more likely you will be able to succeed. Launch Academy staff will serve you as best we can, but you may find that your fellow classmates, who know **exactly** what you are going through, might be the easiest to talk to and even get support from.

### Reflection Questions for 1pm on Thursdays

Once it is time to meet, find a spot in the office or over zoom, and start your check-in. We recommend first catching up. Ask your partner frankly: how are you doing? What is on your mind? It's okay to vent a bit at first, and then we suggest getting into the discussion.

**Please designate a note-taker for your meeting to capture a bulleted list of thoughts and action items as they arise.** We don't want note-taking to get in the way of important discussion, but **you will be expected to provide an informal debrief on your reflection** (don't worry about grammar or style, though - rough notes are fine).

**A note about technical ability:** Everyone is going to be at different stages in understanding the material, especially given how fast-paced this program is. If you find you have a slightly weaker grasp on the material than your partner: _be vulnerable!_ Ask for guidance, or even **go over code from the week together!** If you find you have a better grasp of material from the week than your partner, be supportive, and attempt to share advice or even discuss technical topics as needed. **To teach is to learn!**

Below are some questions to get the discussion flowing. You do not need to go through all of them unless 30 minutes have not yet elapsed. Focus on **sharing insights, sharing things that stumped you, or questions you asked, aiding your partner with concepts they may be struggling with**.

- What are concepts from the curriculum this week that you still feel unsure about? Take a moment to highlight the **toughest** concept, and ask if your partner has any guidance. You are encouraged to share code!

- What insights or "aha" moments did you have this week that you can share with your partner?

- Did you ask any questions in the #questions channel? Share what you learned with your partner - no question is silly, even if it was a small error, it might help your partner in the future!

- How did you work effectively this week? Share what organizational habits help you succeed, or share what habits you hope to adopt next week!

- Was there something you did in the morning or the evening to study better or unwind? What you do outside of the 9-5 hours of the day can make a difference!

- What goals do you have to work more effectively next week?

**Make sure to share your notes in the designated slack channel when done.**

### Submitting your notes

All notes can be collated in the provided `notes.md` file. This file will accept plain text, and additionally any markdown code you want to include. When you're done, you should `et submit` your notes. **Only one partner has to do this each week.**

> _A note on the privacy of your submission:_ If your account settings in Horizon have your submissions set to public, you can always switch specific submissions so that they are private! In fact, we ask that you do for these notes, so that both buddies feel comfortable sharing (you can always omit items from your notes, too, if you prefer).
>
> To mark a particular submission as private, navigate to it by going to this lesson's page in Horizon and clicking the "Submissions" breadcrumb that appears once you submit. On that page, you will see a list of submissions -- click on the "Submission Time" for your submission, and it will take you to the "show page" for that submission. If "Public" says "true", click the blue "Make Private" button, and that will turn your submission to private!

### Suggestions for the Week-to-Week

During the rest of the week, we encourage you to:

**Pair program**: You will be asked to pair with your partner once a week. We'll let you know which days you will be pairing. Usually, this will be on Mondays, and you should stay together at least until 3 pm. After that time, you can talk to your partner about stepping away for solo work instead.

**Share tips and hacks for the week's curriculum**: Collaborate with your code co-pilot, and keep an eye on the #resources Slack channel for other useful information from peers and EEs!

**Commiserate**: This program is tough! It's okay to share just how tough with your buddy. Just make sure that your venting isn't "siloed". If you are having trouble with the curriculum, or if you have feedback, make sure to create an action item to touch bases with an Experience Engineer.
