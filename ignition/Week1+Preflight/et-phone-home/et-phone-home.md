### Introduction

This is your first chance to use your freshly minted dev environment to submit
a challenge!


### Instructions

From inside your `challenges` folder

```no-highlight
et get et-phone-home
cd et-phone-home
code .
```

Your work will go in the file named `ring.txt`. You'll find a number of questions inside of `ring.txt`. Update the `ring` file with your answers, then save. 

Back in the terminal, run `et submit` to submit your work to Horizon.

### Tips

Insert a new-line after every 80 characters when writing in plain text documents. This goes for code files, as well!

This will provide a pleasant reading experience when viewing your
submission in Horizon.
