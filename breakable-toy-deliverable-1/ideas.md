# Breakable Toy Ideas

- Game?
- Weather app
  - Physical unit
  - Dial tells weather conditions/temp
  - Pi? Arduino?
- Forum
  - For what?

## Weather app

***What is the very first feature you will start out with? (This means 1-2 models, and some simple functionality that you can deploy early.)***

- First: the ability for the user to log into the site, and view their locations weather.

***Are there several models involved in your app, along with CRUD for each one? (There should be!)***

- Create: the user can post and comment on the forum.

- Read: user should be able to see the (weather) data on their arduino/pi external unit.

- Update: ability to edit comments/posts

- Delete: delete comments/posts

***Does my idea align with my personal hobbies or interests? If not, it might be tough staying personally invested in building out this idea.***

- Aligns with my interests for sure, grabbing data and using it in a useful manner is fun.

***Can my idea be implemented as a web application written in the frameworks we've learned? If not, that's a problem. Your Breakable Toy is required to be a web application, written in the fullstack framework you've learned here at Launch, with Unit and Feature Tests.***

- Yes as long as the PI can run ruby.

***Is one of your idea's main features interactive in a way that would be well-suited to utilizing React? You will be required to implement at least a portion of your front-end with the React.js library.***

- Yes, the homepage and forum will be heavily styled.

***Do you have some ideas for "fancy" features you can incorporate into your app if you have time? (e.g., external APIs, data visualization, cool JS or React features?)***

- Voice weather updates would be cool

## Game

***What is the very first feature you will start out with? (This means 1-2 models, and some simple functionality that you can deploy early.)***

- First: the ability for the user to log into the site.

***Are there several models involved in your app, along with CRUD for each one? (There should be!)***

- Create: user will be able to sign up, creating an account

- Read: when a user logs in they can view their score and info

- Update: update score by playing

- Delete:

***Does my idea align with my personal hobbies or interests? If not, it might be tough staying personally invested in building out this idea.***

- I play games all the time, and appreciate a well-made game.

***Can my idea be implemented as a web application written in the frameworks we've learned? If not, that's a problem. Your Breakable Toy is required to be a web application, written in the fullstack framework you've learned here at Launch, with Unit and Feature Tests.***

- I think so, the game will be a simple word game with an account you are associated with (or the device you use hmmm)

***Is one of your idea's main features interactive in a way that would be well-suited to utilizing React? You will be required to implement at least a portion of your front-end with the React.js library.***

- Yes the main game page will be react.

***Do you have some ideas for "fancy" features you can incorporate into your app if you have time? (e.g., external APIs, data visualization, cool JS or React features?)***

- Basing the score/streak on the ip address would be nice. 

- Streak might not be too hard
